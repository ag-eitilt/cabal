The 'subdir' field of a source-repository is not a good relative path: "trailing same directory segment: ."
Unfortunately, the files 'files/<>/*.txt', 'c/**/*.c', 'C:foo/bar', '||s' are not valid file names on Windows which would cause portability problems for this package. Windows file names cannot contain any of the characters ":*?<>|" and there are a few reserved names including "aux", "nul", "con", "prn", "com1-9", "lpt1-9" and "clock$".
'hs-source-dirs: ../../assoc/src' is a relative path outside of the source tree. This will not work when generating a tarball with 'sdist'.
'extra-source-files: files/**/*.txt/' is not good relative path: trailing slash
'extra-source-files: files/../foo.txt' is not good relative path: parent directory segment: ..
'license-file: LICENSE2/' is not good relative path: trailing slash
'license-file: .' is not good relative path: trailing dot segment
'hs-source-dirs: src/.' is not good relative path: trailing same directory segment: .
'hs-source-dirs: src/../src' is not good relative path: parent directory segment: ..
'hs-source-dirs: src/../../assoc/src' is not good relative path: parent directory segment: ..
'hs-source-dirs: ../../assoc/src' is not good relative path: parent directory segment: ..
